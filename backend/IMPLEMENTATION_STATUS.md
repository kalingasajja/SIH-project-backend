- **Validation**: Custom validation utilities
- **Response Formatting**: Standardized API responses

### API Structure
```
/api/auth/*          - Authentication endpoints
/api/farmer/*        - Farmer operations
/api/manufacturer/*  - Manufacturer operations
/api/tester/*        - Quality testing operations
/api/customer/*      - Consumer operations
/api/regulator/*     - Regulatory operations
```

## üîß Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
```env
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
QR_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-qr-encryption-key
```

### Hyperledger Fabric Setup
1. Network configuration files
2. Connection profiles for each organization
3. Wallet management for user identities
4. Smart contract deployment

## üìä Data Models

### Core Entities
- **Farmers** - Collection event creators
- **Manufacturers** - Processing event creators
- **Testers** - Quality test event creators
- **Customers** - Product verification and consumption
- **Regulators** - Compliance monitoring and auditing

### Event Types
1. **COLLECTION** - Herb collection from farm
2. **PROCESSING** - Manufacturing and processing
3. **QUALITY_TEST** - Laboratory testing
4. **TRANSPORTATION** - Logistics and shipping
5. **DISTRIBUTION** - Wholesale distribution
6. **RETAIL_SALE** - Final consumer sale

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn
- Hyperledger Fabric network (when ready)

### Installation
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Running the Server
```bash
npm start
# or
node src/server.js
```

### API Testing
The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üìù Next Steps
